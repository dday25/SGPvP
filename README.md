# The Scorpion Guard's Better PvP Pardus Extension

**SGPvP** is a browser extension that enhances the user interface of the online
space game [Pardus](http://www.pardus.at/). It adds keyboard shortcuts to player
vs. player combat, giving you an edge in speed while engaged in a dogfight.

* [Install SGPvP for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ddadeeakniimjcbfnoiacbhpgkfmeoic)
* [Install SGPvP for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/pardus-sgpvp/) (Val's version)

Once installed, reload your Pardus tab, press the key _i_ (for _info_), and find
and click the link to the online help; this will get you started.

**Firefox users: please note that the Greasemonkey version is now deprecated**, it will
not be supported or updated any more. Firefox users should remove it and install
the version from Mozilla Add-ons.

This extension is approved by the Pardus developers.
